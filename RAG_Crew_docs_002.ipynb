      "of its 8th edition. This is due to the wealth of new information that needs to be incorporated for the readers. This book \n",
      "has been in service to the medical fraternity for the last 35 years. It primarily aims at the medical students, trainee residents, practicing doctors, and the midwives. It has evolved to provide comprehensive and updated information in a concise and easy-to-read format. The objective of this edition is to provide the current cutting-edge information to enable the candidates to qualify the examinations in India; and, their equivalents, internationally.\n",
      "All the chapters are thoroughly revised and updated. It is our great pleasure for this edition that Sir Prof. Sabaratnam \n",
      "Arulkumaran has been kind enough to revise thoroughly the two important topics: (a ) Normal Labor (Chapter–13) ; \n",
      "and, (b) Intrapartum Fetal Monitoring (Chapter–39). We are deeply indebted to Prof. BN Chakravorty for updating the \n",

      "of instruments, specimens, sonograms, MR images and drugs, is of immense value, specifically for the practical part of the examinations. The complete information in Chapter 42 amounts to a ‘mini textbook-cum-color atlas’ in obstetrics.\n",
      "The contemporaneous guidelines from different professional and academic organizations such as RCOG, ACOG, WHO, \n",
      "FIGO, NICHD, CDC, NICE, ICOG and DIPSI are provided. Management options based on experience derived from a large number of obstetric services, are also mentioned. This is particularly so in a situation where no evidence exists or it is difficult to follow due to limitation of resources. \n",

      "The uniqueness of the text lies in its presentation, which is simple, lucid and unambiguous. Inclusion of summary \n",
      "tables, algorithms, boxes, flowcharts and the key points in each chapter is the special attraction. These are for quick revision and recapitulation before the examination. With its double-column presentation, reading of the text has been made easier and more comfortable. \n",

      "Preface to the Ninth EditionOver the years, there was an absolute dearth of a single comprehensive textbook of obstetrics, worth to be prescribed to \n",
      "the students. Moreover, of the textbooks currently available, most have been written with an orientation for the developed countries.\n",
      "Being constantly insisted and hard-pressed by my beloved students, I ultimately decided to write a compact, \n",
      "comprehensive and practically oriented textbook of obstetrics. It is an attempt to encourage the students to learn obstetrics in a comparatively easy way. The aim was to emphasize the simplicities rather than complexities of knowledge. The book is written in a clear and concise language and in author’s own style, which holds the reader’s interest. Controversies are avoided and the management of the obstetrical problems is being highlighted with the facilities available to most of the Third World countries. Extensive illustrations and flow charts (schemes) have been used as and when needed to add lucidity and clarity to the subject and to emphasize the practical nature of the book.\n",
      "Although the book has been written primarily for the undergraduates, it should also prove to be useful to nurses \n",
      "(midwives), those aspiring for diploma and postgraduate degrees in obstetrics, and also to the practicing obstetricians. I, however, do not consider this book to be an ideal one but a humble attempt has been made to remove the bottlenecks, as far as possible, of the books available to the students at present.\n",

In some cases (10%), when the collateral circulation fails to open up, the venous return of the heart may be seriously curtailed. This results in production of hypotension, tachycardia and syncope. The normal BP is quickly restored by turning the patient to lateral position.  \n",

      "—\n",
      " Position:  Positions of the woman during delivery may \n",
      "be lateral, squatting or partial sitting (45°). Dorsal \n",
      "position with 15° left lateral tilt is commonly favored \n",

      "CONDUCTION OF DELIVERY : The assistance required in \n",

      "1. Delivery of the head\n",
      "2. Delivery of the shoulders\n",
      "3. Delivery of the trunk\n",
      " Delivery of the head:  The principles to be followed \n",
      "are to maintain flexion of the head, to prevent its early extension and to regulate its slow escape out of the vulval outlet.\n",
      " The patient is encouraged for the bearing-down efforts \n",
      "during uterine contractions. This facilitates descent of the head.\n",
      " When the scalp is visible for about 5 cm in diameter, \n",
      "flexion of the head is maintained during contractions. This is achieved by pushing the occiput downward  \n",
      "and backward by using thumb and index fingers of the left hand while pressing the perineum by the right palm with a sterile vulval pad. If the patient passes stool, it should be cleaned and the region is washed with antiseptic lotion.\n",
      " The process is repeated during subsequent contra  - \n",
      "ctions until the subocciput is placed under the symphysis pubis. At this stage, the maximum diameter of the head (biparietal diameter) stretches the vulval outlet without any recession of the head even after the contraction is over, and it is called ‘crowning of \n",
      "the head’ (Fig . 13.22). The purpose of increasing \n",
      "the flexion of the head is to ensure  that the small \n",
      "suboccipitofrontal diameter 10 cm (4\") distends the vulval outlet instead of larger occipitofrontal diameter 11.5 cm (4½\") (Fig. 13.23).\n",
      " When the perineum is fully stretched and threa-  \n",
      "tens to tear especially in primigravidae, episiotomy is done at this stage after prior infiltration with 10 m L \n",
      "of 1% lignocaine. Bulging thinned out perineum is a \n",
      "better criterion than the visibility of 4–5 cm of scalp \n",
      "to decide the time of performing episiotomy (details  \n",
      "in Chapter 37). Episiotomy is done selectively and not as a routine (see p. 528).\n",
      " Slow delivery of the head in between the contra-ctions is to be regulated . This is done when the \n",
      "suboccipitofrontal diameter emerges out. This is \n",
      "accomplished by pushing the chin with a sterile towel covered fingers of the right hand placed over \n",

      "thus born successively over the stretched perineum by extension.\n",
      " Care following delivery of the head:\n",
      "— Immediately following delivery of the head, the \n",
      "mucus and blood in mouth and pharynx are to be wiped  with sterile gauze piece on a little finger. \n",
      "Alternatively, mechanical or electrical sucker may be used. This simple procedure prevents the  \n",
      "serious consequence of mucus blocking the air passage during vigorous inspiratory efforts.\n",
      "— The eyelids are then wiped with sterile dry cotton swabs  using one for each eye starting from \n",
      "the medial to the lateral canthus to minimize contamination of the conjunctival sac.\n",
      "— The neck is then palpated to exclude the presence of any loop of cord (20–25%).  If it is found and if \n",
      "loose enough, it should be slipped over the head or over the shoulders as the baby is being born. But if it \n",

      "increased incidence of retained placenta (1–2%) and consequent increased incidence of manual removal. Of course, accidental administration during delivery of the first baby in undiagnosed twins produces grave danger to the unborn second baby caused by asphyxia due to tetanic contraction of the uterus. Thus, it is imperative \n",
      "to limit its use in twins only following delivery of the second baby.\n",
      " Procedures:  Injection oxytocin 10 units IM (pre -\n",
      "ferred) or methergine 0.2 mg IM is given within 1 minute of delivery of the baby (WHO). The placenta is expected to be delivered soon following delivery of the baby. If  \n",
      "the placenta is not delivered thereafter, it should be delivered forthwith by controlled cord traction (Brandt-Andrews) technique after clamping the cord while the uterus still remains contracted. If the first attempt fails, another attempt is made after 2–3 minutes failing which another attempt is made at 10 minutes. If this still fails, manual removal is to be done. Oxytocic may be given \n",

      "SUMMARY\n",
      " FIRST STAGE OF LABOR\n",
      "First stage of labor starts from the onset of true labor pain and ends with full dilatation of the cervix. Its average duration \n",
      "is about 12 hours in primigravidae and 6 hours in multiparae. First stage consists of latent phase (up to 4 cm of cervical \n",
      "dilatation) and active phase (up to 10 cm). The stage is chiefly concerned with dilatation and effacement of the cervix.\n",
      "The stage is clinically manifested  by progressive uterine contraction, dilatation and ‘effacement’ of the cervix and ultimate \n",
      "rupture of the membranes. Maternal and fetal conditions  remain unaffected except during uterine contraction. Management \n",
      "consists of: (1) Noninterference with watchful expectancy. (2) Women is given encouragement, emotional support and \n",
      "adequate pain relief during the entire course of labor. (3) To monitor carefully the progress of labor, maternal condition and \n",
      "fetal behavior so as to detect any deviation from the normal. (4) Partograph is maintained  (see p. 492).\n",
      "SECOND STAGE OF LABOR\n",
      "The second stage of labor  starts from full dilatation of the cervix and ends with expulsion of the fetus. Its average duration \n",
      "is 2 hours in primigravidae and 30 minutes in multiparae. The stage concerns with the descent and delivery of the fetus \n",
      "through the birth canal. This stage is  clinically manifested by increased frequency and intensity of uterine contractions with \n",
      "appearance of ‘bearing-down’ efforts which result in expulsion of the fetus. The mother may show features of exhaustion. The principles in management are: (1) To assist in the natural expulsion of the fetus slowly and steadily. (2) To prevent \n",
      "perineal injuries. During conduction of delivery, head is delivered slowly in between contractions. Flexion is maintained so that smaller diameter of the head stretches the perineum. Thus, timely performed episiotomy (selective), prevents perineal laceration. Shoulders are delivered slowly with next contraction.  Immediate care of the newborn  includes clearing of the air \n",
      "passage and eyes, clamping and ligaturing of the umbilical cord and Apgar scoring. \n",
      " THIRD STAGE OF LABOR\n",
      "The third stage begins after the expulsion of the fetus and ends with expulsion of the placenta and membranes. Its average \n",
      "duration is 15 minutes . The stage concerns with placental separation and its expulsion. The separation is  achieved by marked \n",
      "reduction in the uterine surface area of the placental site following delivery due to retraction. The placenta being  inelastic, \n",
      "shears off its attachment through the deep spongy decidual layer. There are two ways of separation —central (Schultze) and \n",
      "marginal (Mathews-Duncan). The bleeding is controlled by effective myometrial contraction and retraction (living ligature) and \n",
      "by thrombosis. The expulsion may occur through ‘bearing-down’ efforts or more commonly with assistance. The management \n",
      "is either by employing watchful expectancy or by active management (WHO)  in cases where oxytocin 10 units IV (slowly) \n",
      "or IM/methergine 0.2 mg IV is administered within 1 minute following the delivery of the baby. \n",
      " Tablet misoprostal 600 mg, can be given orally or rectally in cases with home delivery. It can be given by a community \n",

      "  Lactogenesis:  The alveolar cells are the principal  \n",
      "sites for production of milk. Though some secretory \n",
      "activity is evident (colostrum) during pregnancy and accelerated following delivery,  milk secretion actually \n",
      "starts on 3rd or 4th postpartum day . Around this \n",
      "time, the breasts become engorged, tense, tender and feel warm. In spite of a high prolactin level during pregnancy, milk secretion is kept in abeyance.  \n",
      "Probably, steroids—estrogen and progesterone circulating during pregnancy make the breast tissues unresponsive to prolactin. When the estrogen and progesterone are withdrawn following delivery, prolactin begins its milk secretory activity in previously fully developed mammary glands. Prolactin, insulin, \n",
      "growth hormone and glucocorticoids are the impo­rtant hormones in this stage. The secretory activity is \n",
      "also enhanced directly or indirectly by growth hormone, thyroxine and insulin. For milk secretion to occur, \n",

      "  Galactokinesis:  Oxytocin is the major galactoki ­ \n",

      "or ‘milk let down ’ reflex whereby the milk is forced \n",
      "down into the ampulla of the lactiferous ducts, where from it can be expressed by the mother or sucked out by the baby. Presence of the infant or infant’s cry can induce let down without suckling. A sensation of rise of pressure in the breasts by milk experienced by the mother at the beginning of sucking is called ‘draught’. This can also be produced by injection of oxytocin.\n",
      " The milk ejection reflex is inhibited by  factors such as \n",
      "pain, anxiety, breast engorgement or adverse psychic condition (depression). The ejection reflex may be deficient for several days following initiation of milk secretion and results in breast engorgement.\n",

      "the alveoli by retained milk is due to failure of suckling. This causes decrease in milk secretion by the alveolar epithelium. Ductal and alveolar distension due to failure of milk transfer (suckling) is a cause of lactation failure. Milk pressure reduces the rate of production and hence periodic breastfeeding is necessary.\n",
      "MILK PRODUCTION: A healthy mother will produce  \n",
      "about 500–800 mL of milk a day to feed her infant. This requires about 700 Kcal/day for the mother, which must be made up from diet or from her body store. For this purpose a store of about 5 kg of fat during pregnancy is essential to make up any nutritional deficit during lactation. \n",

      "separation such as trauma or hypertension are usually \n",
      "absent. However, pre ­eclampsia may complicate a case \n",
      "of placenta previa. The first bout of bleeding is usually not alarming but subsequent bouts may be heavier than the previous one due to separation of fresh areas of placenta. In majority of cases, bleeding occurs before 38 weeks and earlier bleeding is more likely to occur in major \n",

Right occiput -posterior is five times more common than the left occiput posterior. Dextrorotation of the uterus and the presence of the sigmoid colon on the left disfavor LOP position.\n",
      "Cause: In majority, the cause of the abnormal position \n",

      "is allowed to hang by its own weight. The assistant \n",
      "is asked to give suprapubic pressure with the flat of hand in a downward and backward direction , \n",
      "the pressure is to be exerted more toward the sinciput. The aim is to promote flexion of the head so that favorable diameter is presented to the pelvic cavity. Not more than 1–2 minutes are required to achieve the objective. When the nape of the neck \n",
      "is visible under the pubic arch , the baby is grasped \n",
      "by the ankles with a finger in between the two. Maintaining a steady traction and forming a wide arc of a circle, the trunk is swung in upward and forward direction (Fig. 26.17B). Meanwhile, the left hand is \n",
      "to guard the perineum and slipping the perineum off successively the face and brow. When the mouth \n",
      "is cleared off the vulva , there should be no hurry . \n",
      "Mucus of the mouth and pharynx is cleared by mucus sucker.  The trunk is depressed to deliver rest \n",
      "of the head.\n",
      "b. Forceps delivery: Forceps can be used as a routine. \n",
      "The head must be in the cavity. \n",
      " The advantages are —(a) delivery can be controlled \n",
      "by giving pull directly on the head and the force is not transmitted through the neck, (b) flexion is better maintained, and (c) mucus can be sucked out from the mouth more effectively. The head should be brought as low down as possible by allowing the baby to hang by its own weight aided by suprapubic pressure. When the occiput lies against the back \n",
      "of the symphysis pubis , an assistant raises the legs \n",
      "of the child as much to facilitate introduction of the blades from below. Too much elevation of the trunk may cause extension of the head. The forceps pull maintains an arc, which follows the axis of the birth canal (Fig. 26.18). Ordinary forceps with usual length of shank, as in Das’s variety, is quite effective. Piper forceps is especially designed (absent pelvic \n",

This maintains flexion of the head.

      " Principles:  Because of the curved birth canal, when \n",
      "the anterior shoulder remains above the symphysis pubis, the posterior shoulder will be below the sacral promontory. If the fetal trunk is rotated keeping the back anterior and maintaining a downward traction, the posterior shoulder will appear below the symphysis pubis.\n",
      " Procedure (Figs 26.22A to C):  The baby (wrapped \n",
      "in a warm dry towel) is grasped, using both hands by  Chapter 26  •  Complicated Labor: Malposition, Malpresentation and Cord Prolapse  363\n",

Next pack should be started on the eighth day, irrespective of bleeding (same day of the week, the pill finished). Thus, a simple regime of “3 weeks on and 1 week off” is to be followed . Packing \n",
      "of 28 tablets, there should be no break between packs. Seven of the pills are dummies and contain either iron or vitamin preparations. However, a woman can start the pill up to day 5 of the bleeding. In that case, she is advised to use a condom for the next 7 days. The pill should be started on the day after abortion. Following childbirth in non-lactating woman, it is started after 3 weeks, and in lactating woman, it is to be withheld for 6 months (see  below).\n",

      " Menstrual abnormalities:  Breakthrough bleeding \n",

Other causes of breakthrough bleeding in pill takers are: (i) disturbance of drug absorption—diarrhea, vomiting, (ii) use of enzyme inducing drugs (mentioned earlier), missing pills, use of low dose pills, (iii) pregnancy complications (miscarriage), (iv) diseases—cervical ectopy or carcinoma. Usually, it settles after 3–4 cycles when there is no other specific cause for BTB. Exogenous estrogen (conjugated estrogen 1.25 mg or estradiol 2 mg) given daily for 7 days can control the bleeding. Doubling up the active pills for 2–3 days, or until bleeding stops, is helpful. A pill containing higher dose of estrogen, with different progestin could be helpful. BTB is not associated with any increased failure rate. Hypomenorrhea (PGN): It is of little significance although disturbing to the patient. It is due to the local endometrial changes.

The incision is made by a curved or straight blunt pointed sharp scissors (scalpel may also be used), one blade of which is placed inside in between the fingers and the posterior vaginal wall and the other on the skin. The incision should be made at the height of an uterine contraction when an accurate idea of the extent of incision can be better judged from the stretched perineum.

      "DEFINITION: It is an operative procedure whereby \n",
      "the fetuses after the end of 28th weeks are delivered \n",
      "through an incision on the abdominal and uterine walls. This excludes delivery through an abdominal inci ­\n",

      " Nomenclature and history:  Amidst controversy, it appears \n",
      "that the operation derives its name from the notification ‘lex \n",
      "Cesarea’ – a Roman law promulgated in 715 BC which was continued even during Caesar’s reign. The law provided either an abdominal delivery in a dying woman with a hope to get a live baby or to perform postmortem abdominal delivery for separate burial. The operation does not derive its name from the birth of Caesar, as his mother lived long time after his birth. The other explanation is that the word cesarean is derived from the Latin Verb ‘Cedere’ which means ‘to cut’ . French obstetrician, Francois Mauriceau first reported cesarean section in 1668. In 1876, Porro performed subtotal hysterectomy. It was Max Sanger in 1882, who first sutured the uterine walls. In 1907, Frank described the extraperitoneal operation.
